        <h1 class="h1">HEY THERE! IT'S ME</h1>
        <p>Welcome to PhotoYo, where storytelling unfolds through light, movement, and emotion. I’m Bibek Thatal, the eye behind
            the lens and the energy behind every frame. Photography, for me, is not confined to a single tone or technique—it’s an evolving conversation between subject, space, and moment.







        </p>
        <p>
            My work moves fluidly between color and monochrome, between softness and intensity. I’m drawn to contrasts—the tension
            between stillness and motion, shadow and vibrance, silence and sound. Whether I’m capturing personal portraits, shaping
            brand identities, documenting live performances, or exploring the rhythm of music culture, each photograph becomes a
            narrative fragment—raw, intentional, and alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            PhotoYo is more than a portfolio. It is a creative space where authenticity takes center stage. I seek out real
            expressions over perfection, atmosphere over polish. The goal is not just to document what is seen, but to reveal what
            is felt.
        </p>
        <p>Inspired by cinematic tones, urban textures, and the unpredictable beauty of human emotion, my approach blends edge with
        intimacy. Every session is a collaboration, every frame a step deeper into a story waiting to be told.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is PhotoYo—where moments are not just captured, but transformed into visual experiences that linger long after the
        shutter closes.</p>
